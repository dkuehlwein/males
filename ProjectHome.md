MaLeS is a framework for automated tuning of Automated Theorem Provers.

MaLeS can be used to tune an ATP to a specific problem domain.
Given a set of example problems, and the parameters of the ATP.
MaLeS will automatically
  * Find search strategies that perform well on the test problems.
  * Create an automatic strategy schedule for new problems.
